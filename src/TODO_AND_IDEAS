- define YY_FATAL_ERROR such that exit is never called from the lib
- save file name. To handle this properly, it should be a reference counted
	string.
- how should we handle out-of-range values? Reporting an error may not always
  be the best idea (make it an option!)
- document schema specification, including the constraints

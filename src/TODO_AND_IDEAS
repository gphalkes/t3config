- how should we handle out-of-range values? Reporting an error may not always
  be the best idea
- make testsuite
- figure out a better way to pass back detailed error information. The current
  method is ABI incompatible with the existing one, and can't handle many
  cases in which the memory is discared before return. This happens e.g. in
  parsing and in validation of schemas. The latter problem can be handled by
  copying the required memory. However, this puts the burden of freeing the
  memory on the client wich may be using the existing ABI

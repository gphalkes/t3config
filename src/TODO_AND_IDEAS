- function to open file using a path
- handle windows newline, and perhaps old MAC newline
- how should we handle out-of-range values? Reporting an error may not always
  be the best idea (make it an option!)
- include mechanism. One way would be to use a callback function which should
  return a FILE * when passed a file name. However, that should also be passed
  some user data for the file path etc.
- make testsuite
- document schema specification, including the constraints

Introduction
============

The libt3unicode library provides functions for using and manipulating UTF-8
encoded text. The functions provided can convert UTF-8 into separate
codepoints, return relevant information about codepoints, normalize UTF-8
strings, and more.

libt3unicode is part of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
[http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/]


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

libt3unicode requires the GNU libtool utility to be compiled.

There are two ways in which to compile libt3unicode:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefiles in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
They have been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libt3unicode [http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/libt3unicode.html]. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.

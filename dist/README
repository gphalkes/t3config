Introduction
============

The libt3config library provides functions for reading and writing simple
structured configuration files. libt3config provides the following features:

- simple structured syntax
- simple API for reading and manipulating configurations
- parsed configurations use typed data (boolean, integer, floating point number
  string, list, section)
- thread safe (with the exception that set_locale should not be called at the
  same time in another thread)

libt3config is part of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
[http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/]


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

libt3config requires the GNU libtool utility to be compiled.

There are two ways in which to compile libt3config:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefiles in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
They have been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libt3config [http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/libt3config.html]. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.

Version 0.2.6:
	New features:
	- Added functions to open config files for writing, using a temporary file
	  which will be renamed on close. This also deprecates the use of the
	  functions t3_config_xdg_get_file and t3_config_xdg_close_write.

Version 0.2.5:
	New features:
	- Added functions to easily open files in the directories specified by the
	  XDG Base Directory specification.

	Bug fixes:
	- Initialize the LLthis member of the parser context earlier such that it
	  is initialized when a read error occurs on the very first token read.

Version 0.2.4:
	New features:
	- Added a function to retrieve the number of items in a list or section.
	- Added functions to retrieve a value with user defined default.

	Bug fixes:
	- Initialize the file name member to NULL in all places (one was
	  accidentally omitted in the previous release).

Version 0.2.3:
	New features:
	- Allow retrieval of line number information associated with a t3_config_t
	  structure.
	- Track the file name of t3_config_t structs, and return it on error if the
	  new flag T3_CONFIG_ERROR_FILE_NAME is set.

Version 0.2.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Use LLnextgen version 0.5.5 which fixes a bug in array dimensioning.

Version 0.2.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix pkg-config name,
	- Prevent flex lexer from calling exit.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Schema validation.
	- New list syntax using repeated
		%name = value
	  instead of
		name = ( value, ... )
	- String concatenation to allow strings to be spread over multiple lines,
	  using 'part1' + 'part2' syntax.
	- Main type for configuations renamed from t3_config_item_t to t3_config_t.
	- It is now possible to receive a string with extra information about
	  errors, for example the name of the duplicate key.
	- An inclusion mechanism to read other files, if requested.

	Bug fixes:
	- More checking for validity of values, both when reading as well as when
	  creating a configuration programatically.
	- Allow numeric values to have a leading plus sign.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release

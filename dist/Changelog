Version 0.2.3:
	New features:
	- Allow retrieval of line number information associated with a t3_config_t
	  structure.
	- Track the file name of t3_config_t structs, and return it on error if the
	  new flag T3_CONFIG_ERROR_FILE_NAME is set.

	  using 'part1' + 'part2' syntax.
	- Main type for configuations renamed from t3_config_item_t to t3_config_t.
	- It is now possible to receive a string with extra information about
	  errors, for example the name of the duplicate key.
	- An inclusion mechanism to read other files, if requested.

	Bug fixes:

	  creating a configuration programatically.
